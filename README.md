# SimplySquare

**SimplySquare** was an app marketplace for wooden tiles. I co-founded the company with my brother, Michael Assadi. I developed the iOS app which was built using Swift, UIKit, Stripe, Firebase, and OneSignal notifier (for promo codes). The app detected low-resolution images from the camera roll and upon completion sent them to Greenerprinter servers via a RESTful API.

**To run the app:**
- Make sure to download the newest version of Xcode.
- Open the .workspace file.
- Build and run the application for IOS devices (iphone 6,6s,7,8)
- NOTE: In order for the camera roll collection view to show you must be running on a real IOS device.
