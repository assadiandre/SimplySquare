**To run the app:**

- Make sure to download the newest version of Xcode.
- Open the .workspace file.
- Build and run the application for IOS devices (iphone 6,6s,7,8)
- NOTE: In order for the camera roll collection view to show you must be running on a real IOS device.

**Additional Notes**

This was my first project in Xcode. It included notifications with One Signal, in app payments with Stripe, linked promotion codes with a Firebase database, and much more. I am very proud of this app and although it was never published I finished the project and gained a lot of experience.
